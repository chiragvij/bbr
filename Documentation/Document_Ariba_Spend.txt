Step 2:
3 Matl Groups --> Use it as it is to Fixed Material Number


For the ones with Vendor Material Number is NOT NULL 

Step 3A:
Not covered in Step-2 / Use the query --> check for Vendor Mat# to Mat# Mapping (Join without Plant and then with Plant) 

Step 3B: 
check for Vendor Mat CLEANED**# to Mat# Mapping (Join without Plant and then with Plant) 



Step 4:
Check for Vendor Mat Number  with your Inventorised Opex

1) Vendor Material Number with exact 1 mapping existing which has FINAL_MATERIAL_NO / No splitting etc
2) Vendor Material Number with more than 1 mapping existing : 
	Look for the material# whose transaction / line item is minimum ( np.nanmin & Postive Quantity) / 
	Outcome : Update the Fixed Material Number with "FINAL_MATERIAL_NO" info.
	

[Optional]
Step 5:
Check for Vendor Mat Number Cleaned**  with your Inventorised Opex

1) Vendor Material Number with exact 1 mapping existing which has FINAL_MATERIAL_NO / No splitting etc
2) Vendor Material Number with more than 1 mapping existing : 
	Look for the material# whose transaction / line item is minimum ( np.nanmin & Postive Quantity) / 
	Outcome : Update the Fixed Material Number with "FINAL_MATERIAL_NO" info.

Step 6 :
Draw the similarity measure between Ariba transactions (remaining out of Step-5) with the Inventorised PO similarity

1. Highest Similarity
2. Minimum PO Rate
3. Highest Material Number

Step 7:

======
-- For all English Characters with lower case

-- Ariba: 
-- Service Contract : 
    -- Final Text :
    -- Prefer NAME first / wherever NAME = 'nan' Take PO_TEXT
-- Non Service Contract : 
    -- Final Text :
    -- Prefer PO_TEXT / Name 

-- Inventorised
    -- Final Text : 
        -- DESCRIPTION / PO_TEXT / NAME
